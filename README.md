# Introduction
Sadly streaming and content creation has become a target for malicious activity. People being doxed and hate raided. What is hate raiding? [TheVerge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620874/twitch-implements-improved-chat-filters#:~:text=In%20hate%20raids%2C%20a%20streamer,with%20hate%20speech%20and%20harassment.)

Because of this ongoing issue and lack of tools around on Twitch to remedy this growing problem I have gone ahead and started this repo as a database to document known accounts for doxing/information gathering and hate raiding. If you, someone you know encounter a hate raid or you see accounts associated with it, please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/defcantgame/bannable_accounts/issues/1) and create a new issue. I will go through and add them to the list.

## Working on
I am currently working on finishing a quick script that will automatically send each username to your stream and ban them. If support for this is big enough and requested then a website tool can be made in the future to further help everyone.
